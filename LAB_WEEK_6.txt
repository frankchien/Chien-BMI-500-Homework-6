SUBMISSION PROTOCOL: 
Put all code in a .py file. 
Prepare a report for the answers to the following questions. 
Submit both the .py files and the report.

1. You are provided two text files (text1 and text2)
a) Preprocess the two texts by lowercasing them.
b) Follow the instructions on https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html
to vectorize the two texts using the CountVectorizer. Use n-gram size of 1-3 for the vectorizer.
c) Compute the cosine similarity between the texts (sklearn provides a function for it).
d) Compute the jaccard similarity between text1 and text2

2. Read section 4 and 5 of the nltk book: https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html.
a) Follow the instructions to train a POS tagger.
Show the performance of different taggers (e.g., unigram, bigram and combined taggers) on your chosen corpus (e.g. the brown corpus).
Use 90% of the data for training and 10% for evaluation.
Compare the performances of at least 3 taggers.
Save and load the tagger.
Use a trained tagger to tag all the words from text1.
Can lowercasing affect the performance of the POS tagger? (Put your answer as comment in python file)


3. What are some of the possible NLP components of a Question Answering System?
